# Welcome To VRC Haptics
This is a project dedicated to creating cheap, versitile, and performant haptics available for everyone.

# Where to go?
Currently there are four main repositories:
 - [Server](https://github.com/VRC-Haptics/VRCH-GUI): For handling haptics to game coordination.
 - [Firmware](): To flash and run on the haptic devices.
 - Hardware: For guides, printable files, PCB's, and other hardware solutions.
 - Prefabs: Providing ready-built and configured prefabs to integrate with unity.

***This project is still in its infancy and so the ecosystem has yet to mature. But plans are in the works***
