# Welcome To VRC Haptics
This is a project dedicated to creating cheap, versitile, and performant haptics available for everyone.

This project was started with the goal of elimintating annoying bugs in already existing setups and lowering overall barriers to entry. These goals have not changed, but the scope has temporarily been limited to VRChat (VRC). This is so that a functioning ecosystem can be assembled with the goal of supporting further devolpment and expansion to provide more coverage as time goes on.

# Directory:
Currently there are four main repositories:
 - [Server](https://github.com/VRC-Haptics/VRCH-GUI): For handling haptics to game coordination.
 - [Firmware](https://github.com/VRC-Haptics/VRCH-Firmware): To flash and run on the haptic devices.
 - [Hardware](https://github.com/VRC-Haptics/VRCH-Hardware): For guides, printable files, PCB's, and other hardware solutions.
 - Prefabs (Under construction currently): Providing ready-built and configured prefabs to integrate with unity.

# What's next:
There are a few prioritites that are being worked on currently:
 1. Update Prefabs and VRCFury integration (loose vrcf maybe?)
 1. Easier Firmware Configuration
 1. Easier Firmware Upload/Upgrade
 1. Further Integrations with VRC
 1. Support for other games
    1. Support for bluetooth connected haptics
    1. Support for currently existing "standards"
